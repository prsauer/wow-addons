spell effect model

A triggers B

C affects D (passive modifiers)

implies two graphs
trigger graphs
affect graph

1
Ingest all spell data
-Record lists of triggers
-Record lists of affects

2
Build triggers graph
-One node per spell
-Iterate over all nodes, linking

3
Repeat (2) for affects

4
Traverse triggers graph
Bubble up PvP effects
Ex: A triggers B triggers C
If C has a PvP modifier, we should bubble that info up to B's node
If B has a PvP modifier, we should bubble that info plus the subgraph below it up to A's node
Concrete:
Spell A (the hunt) triggers a dash (spell B), dot (spell C), and nuke (spell D)
Spell C is nerfed by 25% in PvP
Spell A's tooltip (the one on your bars) should include info about the nerf to C
"Affected by 25% nerf to B"

5
Traverse affects graph
Bubble down pvp modifiers on affects
Ex: A affects B
If A has a pvp modifier, that info should be bubbled down to B's node
Concrete:
Mastery bonus of 10% from A nerfed to 5% in PvP
Mastery affects ability B
B's tooltip should make note of this
"Affected by 5% nerf to A in PvP"
